## Omnirope – Usage Tutorial

### Purpose of the Product
The Omnirope is designed to improve comfort and biomechanics during cable-based exercises by reducing grip strain and allowing a more natural range of motion.

---

### Setup
1. Attach the Omnirope to a cable machine using a standard carabiner.
2. Ensure the attachment point is fully closed and secure.
3. Adjust the cable height depending on the exercise being performed.

---

### Proper Usage
