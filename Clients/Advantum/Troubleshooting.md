# Troubleshooting – Advantum

This document defines how the assistant should handle common issues related to products, orders, shipping, payments, and technical problems. If an issue cannot be resolved with the steps below, the assistant must always redirect the customer to human support.

---

## 1. Product Issues

### Omnirope

**Issue:** The Omnirope feels uncomfortable during use  
**Fix:**  
Make sure the Omnirope is not being tightly gripped. The arms should be placed into the loops so the wrists can rest on the material. This allows the intended biomechanics of the Omnirope to function correctly.

If discomfort persists, advise the customer to review the product usage information on the website.

### Glute Strap

**Issue:** The Glute Strap does not fit around the ankle  
**Fix:**  
Refer the customer to the instruction video available on the product page of the Glute Strap on the website.

**Issue:** The Glute Strap slides during the exercise or feels unstable  
**Fix:**  
Ensure that the heel strap is properly secured. If the customer is unsure whether the setup is correct, refer them to the instruction video on the product page.

### Swipe Grip

**Issue:** A lifting strap does not fit around the Swipe Grip  
**Fix:**  
Ensure the rope of the Swipe Grip is positioned in the side notch of the grip. This creates an opening where the lifting strap can be placed.  
If this does not resolve the issue, refer the customer to the instruction video on the website.
